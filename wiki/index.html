The purpose of this device is to help track a user’s skiing metrics to help them better understand how they performed and what they can work to improve.

                                            Before describing the technology, it is important to list the different metrics that we will be tracking. These include:  
                                        </p>
                                        <ul class="a">
                                            <li>Run time</li>
                                            <li>Distance travelled</li>
                                            <li>Average speed</li>
                                            <li>Average altitude</li>
                                            <li>Location (Latitude and Longitude)</li>
                                        </ul>

                                            Although there are a wider variety of metrics that could possibly be tracked, we felt that these are the most essential to track to inform the user of their progress and allow them to learn from them.
                                        </p>

                                            This architecture diagram represents the structure of the wearable device. 
                                            The wearable connects to our mobile app via bluetooth to obtain the WiFi credentials. Once obtained, the wearable can now upload run data to the Coachable API using an HTTP POST request. 
                                            For this to happen, we will be using the SparkFun ESP32 Thing board, which comes with built-in Bluetooth and WIFI capabilities, integrated LiPo battery charging, 4MB flash memory, and 520kB SRAM.
                                            This board was chosen as it provides efficient speeds while reducing the size of the device. 
                                            Our first sensor is the SparkFun ESP32 Thing Motion Shield. This sensor tracks angular velocity, acceleration and heading. It also has a micro SD slot and a JST port for connecting a GPS.
                                            We are also using the Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout sensor that has -165 dBm sensitivity, 10 Hz updates, 66 channels, and a built-in antenna.
                                            We are using the MPL3115A2 I2C Barometric Pressure/Temperature/Altitude Sensor Breakout Board for tracking additional data.
                                            All this hardware will be stored within a 3D printed case that we will attach to the boot of a skier.

                                        <p>
                                            So, why us? Upon hours of research, we have concluded that there are plenty of high-tech competitors in the marketplace right now. However, some of these competitors are just mobile apps, while others are physical devices such as goggles, watches, or ski clamps (device attached to ski itself). 
                                            Since the device is exclusive to Coachable, we have taken into consideration professional skiers who are not aloud any device on their body. This issue can be bypassed if the device is clamped onto to boot.
