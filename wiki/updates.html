                                <h4>Week of: March 24, 2020</h4>
                                <p>Our team has revised and started implementing the front-end code for our website to ensure for easy use.</p>
                                <p>We are looking into HashID's for the URL, to help ensure you cant access a specific page when you are not allowed to</p>
                                <p>Our ESP32 is looking good, there was some changes to the way json data is saved but more successful testing has been done.</p>
                                <p>We have started revising this wiki, our SRS, and our video to meet end of month milestones.</p>

                                <p>The parsing of the "data" field in JSON has been parsed out and now be used into graphs</p>
                                <p>For the ESP32 board, severe serial bluetooth issues were fixed, resulting in successful operation/integration.</p>
                                <p>Due to the coronavirus spread, our team/school was apart of the transition period, reducing the amount of work done due to work from home only</p>

                                <h4>Week of: March 10, 2020</h4>
                                <p>Our team has configured AWS/Azure services to host our DB and our API so the laravel application and wearable can access data.</p>
                                <p>Our ESP32 now utilises serial bluetooth, which is used for messaging/sending data over bluetooth </p>

                                <h4>Week of: March 3, 2020</h4>
                                <p>The Coachable API has been altered to now accept proper JSON from the ESP32 hardware</p>
                                <p>Our laravel application can display proper data from DB using collections and blade.</p>
                                <p>Our team was investigating OTG and its implementation, but decided to scrap it. The ESP32 board has been tested more and we have added more data fields for JSON output.</p>
                                <p>Our team participated in the 4x4 event, reducing the amount of hours we contributed this week. However, it was a great experience for us to learn and have fun.</p>

                                <p>Our laravel application has been adapted to contain multiple controllers instead of one, decoupling the logic between roles</p>
                                <p>Besides cleaning/testing the code, the ESP32 board can now write json data to the SD card, and can store data in memory if SD is not available.</p>

                                <p> After our meeting last week, we met and discussed with Adrian the true scope of the website and the schema revolving around it, which we are creating in Laravel. This helps our team ensure scope is narrowed so we can remain on track  </p>

                                <p>While development on the laravel application is underway, our team has received the necessary hardware components to actually start putting the pieces together.</p>
                                <p>We have also started a mobile application that will replicate the websites functionality.</p>

                                <p>During this week, tasks were split amongst the group to ensure production in all fields.</p>
                                <p>After talking with Adrian from Coachable, our team started developing a website using Laravel and Vue.js, which we can use to log in and see the users metrics</p>
                                <p>While some worked on this aspect of the project, others continued work on the board to make use of its built in sensors. We still don't have the hardware we need.</p>

                                <p> After doing some research on different topics surrounding the development of this project, our team has created a very basic API, a website to interact with it, and this wiki.</p>
                                <p> Our team has started developing on a raspberry PI 3 and Android Studio since we didn't have the proper hardware in. Team is working to try and connect the two to help form the basis of our architecture.</p>
